# Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance

`Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance` is the tenant-governance companion package for Cephalon multi-tenancy workloads.

## What it owns

- tenant membership descriptors, registries, catalogs, and contributor contracts
- host-defined and module-contributed membership merge behavior
- one Cephalon-managed tenant-membership evaluation baseline
- `tenancy.membership.catalog` and `tenancy.membership.evaluation` capabilities when the `MultiTenancy` technology is active
- the `tenant-memberships` technology runtime surface under `multi-tenancy`
- stable governance diagnostics for allowed and denied membership evaluation
- a separate runtime ownership boundary from the base `Cephalon.MultiTenancy` tenant-resolution pack

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/MultiTenancyGovernanceOptions.cs`
- `Modules/MultiTenancyGovernanceModule.cs`
- `Registration/MultiTenancyGovernanceEngineBuilderExtensions.cs`

## How it fits

The base `Cephalon.MultiTenancy` package intentionally stays focused on tenant resolution and ambient tenant context. This companion package owns the first concrete governance runtime proof beside that base package: a tenant membership catalog plus a deterministic evaluator that can answer whether a principal has active membership and the required tenant-local roles.

Memberships can come from host options or installed module contributors through `ITenantMembershipContributor`. The catalog de-duplicates memberships by tenant id, principal kind, and principal id, and the evaluator uses that same tenant/principal-kind/principal-id boundary so user, group, service, and organization identifiers cannot bleed roles across kinds. Evaluation checks active, suspended, expired, and missing-role states without leaking host-specific identity APIs into the engine core.

The resulting operator-facing answer flows through `/engine/technology-surfaces` and `/engine/snapshot` as the `tenant-memberships` surface. The summary entry reports membership count, tenant count, contributor count, configured membership count, and evaluation ownership. Per-tenant entries summarize membership posture, role names, principal-kind breakdown, and contributing modules without exposing individual principal identifiers.

This is intentionally a narrow managed proof. The package now owns membership cataloging and membership evaluation, but it does not yet own tenant invitations, domain ownership verification, approval workflows, remediation workflows, backoffice tenant administration, public-site onboarding, durable membership stores, or provider-specific identity synchronization. Those should land as later governance slices only when the package truly owns those paths.
