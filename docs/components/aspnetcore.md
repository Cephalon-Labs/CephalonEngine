# Cephalon.AspNetCore

`Cephalon.AspNetCore` is the HTTP-first host core for Cephalon.

## What it owns

- ASP.NET Core service registration for the engine
- project-level split-configuration loading through `AddCephalonProjectConfigurations()` and `AddCephalon(...)`
- runtime startup and shutdown integration through hosted services
- `/engine/*` metadata, status, diagnostics, and policy endpoints
- `/engine/package-policy`, `/engine/packages`, and the rest of the engine governance surface
- `/health`, `/health/live`, and `/health/ready` surfaces
- opt-in HTTP request/response logging with bounded request and response body capture plus default sensitive-value redaction under `Engine:Observability:HttpLogging`
- OpenAPI and Scalar integration for REST APIs
- optional hosted reference-doc delivery through `ReferenceDocs` host configuration
- built-in REST, SSE, and WebSocket transport route mapping
- companion adapter hooks for GraphQL, JSON-RPC, and gRPC transport packages

## Main surfaces

- `Hosting/EngineWebApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs`

## How it fits

This package keeps the HTTP host thin. Most behavior stays in the engine or modules, while the host package maps runtime state and selected transports into ASP.NET Core primitives.

When teams choose to publish XML-comment-driven reference output, this host can also serve those static assets directly. That hosting surface is optional and sits beside the hand-authored `.md` guides instead of replacing them.

It also owns the ASP.NET Core side of Cephalon's split-configuration convention. Hosts can keep settings in `Configurations/Add*.json` and `Configurations/{group}/{Environment}.json`, and those files are loaded automatically when `AddCephalon(...)` runs.

When operators need deeper HTTP diagnostics, the same host surface can turn on request/response logging through `Engine:Observability:HttpLogging` or `AddCephalonHttpLogging(...)`. That flow keeps correlation in the shared `ILogger` pipeline by pushing `RequestId`, `TraceId`, `SpanId`, and `TraceParent` into request scopes, redacts known-sensitive query-string and payload fields before the log event is written, including JSON, form, and header-style `text/plain` content, and publishes the corresponding event-id range through `/engine/diagnostics`.
